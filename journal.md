- Found a suitable and royalty free model [here](https://www.cgtrader.com)
- UV maps were misplaced. Made new UV maps from scratch using Blender (still not perfect, though)
- Written shaders for point light with uniform ambient light and ambient occlusion
- Found some royalty free textures [here](https://3dtextures.me)
- Added the library ObjectControls.js to control the object
- Some parts of the model had the normals flipped. Corrected
- Zoom in ObjectControls.js not working properly. Corrected
- Added ground, fog and shadow of the object
- Made user interface
- Written a function to make materials using the shader
- Created some materials with the textures mentioned above
- Loaded all the components of the model with these new materials
- Made buttons to change the materials of some components

- TODO: add shadows on the object (!)
- TODO: make different shaders for different types of material
- TODO: improve model (make better uv maps, fix holes and overlaps)
- TODO: improve user interface (make instructions, keep track of selected items, add loading animation)
